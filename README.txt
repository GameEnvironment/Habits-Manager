This app is made to help you get better habits. The goal here is to do great things to gain money, with which you then can buy some pleasures. 
If the activity isn't in those already given, you can click on the "other" button and write the activity and its cost.
In the next version, there is going to be the possibility to add your own category (less than 10 anyway), but we don't know the date of the next release version. Stai in touch !
We are planning others projects to go out for the public, but we aren't active on social networks for the moment, but that will soon change.
If you leave the app and come back again, your activity should still be printed (we use local storage to keep data).
The portable version is made if you encounter any problem linked with the script file (if you want to share it, for exemple). Sometimes you may get a warning that there is a javascript file. If that is the case, try with the portable version. 

Thanks for using this app and enjoy. 
If you notice any bug or have any idea to improve the app, notice us and we'll seek out a solution. 
Enjoy the experiment.
